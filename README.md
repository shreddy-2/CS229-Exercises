# Stanford CS229 - Machine Learning - Exercises

In order to learn more about machine learning, I am following the 2022 Stanford class CS-229: _Machine Learning_. The lectures are available on Youtube on the Stanford Online channel ([here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rNyWOpJg_Yh4NSqI4Z4vOYy)). 

To practice what I am learning, I am also implementing the algorithms taught in the lectures in Python. It is these implementations that are recorded in this repository. 

The codebase is split into separate _Jupyter Notebook_ files according to the chapter of the notes that they cover.

### Chapters:
1. [Linear Regression](chapter_1.ipynb)
2. [Logistic Regression](chapter_2.ipynb)
